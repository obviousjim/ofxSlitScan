 *
 * ofxSlitScan is a simple utility for creating slit scan
 * effects and video time delays. It works by keeping a 
 * rolling buffer of video frames that can be sampled
 * from arbitrarly via a warp map 
 *
 * For inspiring works using this effect, check out Golan Levin's page
 * on Slit Scan artworks
 *
 * http://www.flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/
 *
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * First call set up with the width and height that matches the video you want to process
 * after calling setup, use any image to set the delay map 
 * then with every incoming frame call addImage();
 * Calling getOutputImage will return a reference to the warped / delayed video frame
